        <h1>History of Space Exploration</h1>
        <p>Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technologies. This history spans many milestones and breakthroughs, from the early days of the space race to modern-day explorations of other planets and moons in our solar system. Here, we highlight several major achievements in space exploration: the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Sputnik's launch, the ISS, Curiosity Rover, and the Mars Rover missions.</p>

            <h2>Apollo 11 Mission: The First Moon Landing</h2>
            <img src="apollo11.jpg" alt="Apollo 11" class="history-img">
            <p>The Apollo 11 mission, conducted by NASA, was a historic moment for humanity, marking the first time that humans landed on the Moon. The mission's spacecraft, launched on July 16, 1969, was crewed by three astronauts: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, while Collins remained in lunar orbit aboard the command module, Columbia.</p>
            <p>The event was watched by millions around the world, and Armstrong’s famous words, “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind,” still resonate in history today. The astronauts collected rock samples, planted the American flag, and set up scientific instruments. The mission lasted 8 days, 3 hours, 18 minutes, and 35 seconds, and it was the first of six successful Moon landings under NASA’s Apollo program.</p>
            <p>Apollo 11 not only demonstrated the United States' technological prowess but also showcased the collaborative spirit of humanity. It paved the way for further lunar exploration and inspired generations of scientists, engineers, and explorers to look beyond our planet.</p>
            <p>Additional key facts about Apollo 11:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Saturn V rocket used to launch Apollo 11 remains the tallest and most powerful rocket ever built.</li>
                <li>The Lunar Module, nicknamed “Eagle,” was used for the Moon landing, while the Command Module was named “Columbia.”</li>
                <li>The total mission cost was approximately $355 million (equivalent to over $2 billion today).</li>

        <!-- Sputnik section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Soviet Union's Sputnik: The First Artificial Satellite</h2>
            <img src="sputnik.jpg" alt="Sputnik" class="history-img">
            <p>Sputnik 1 was the first artificial Earth satellite, launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957. It marked the beginning of the space age and triggered the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States. Sputnik weighed 83.6 kg (183.9 lbs) and transmitted radio signals back to Earth for 21 days before its battery was depleted. It remained in orbit for several months before it re-entered Earth's atmosphere and burned up on January 4, 1958.</p>
            <p>The launch of Sputnik had a profound impact on science, technology, and geopolitics. It sparked international concerns about the possibility of Soviet technological superiority, leading to the establishment of NASA and a series of new space programs in the U.S. The event also led to the development of satellite communication, weather forecasting, and GPS systems.</p>
            <p>Additional key facts about Sputnik:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Soviet Union launched Sputnik using the R-7 rocket, which was originally designed as a missile.</li>
                <li>The success of Sputnik spurred the development of the U.S. Explorer satellite program, which launched the first successful American satellite into space in January 1958.</li>
                <li>Sputnik's launch is considered one of the most significant achievements of the Cold War era.</li>

            <h2>International Space Station (ISS): A Global Collaboration in Space</h2>
            <img src="iss.jpg" alt="International Space Station" class="history-img">
            <p>The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station that orbits the Earth, serving as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory. The ISS is a joint project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (USA), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), and CSA (Canada). It has been continuously inhabited by astronauts since November 2, 2000, making it one of the longest-running space missions.</p>
            <p>The ISS is used for scientific research in a variety of fields, including biology, physics, astronomy, and meteorology. Its orbit allows for the study of the effects of microgravity on living organisms and the development of new technologies that can benefit life on Earth. The station also plays a crucial role in preparing for future deep-space missions, including those to Mars.</p>
            <p>Additional key facts about the ISS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ISS orbits the Earth at an average altitude of about 420 kilometers (260 miles) and travels at speeds of approximately 28,000 km/h (17,500 mph).</li>
                <li>The station is made up of pressurized modules for crew living and working, as well as external structures for solar arrays and scientific instruments.</li>
                <li>The ISS has hosted astronauts from over 19 different countries and remains a symbol of international collaboration in space.</li>
